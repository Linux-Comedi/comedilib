		Configuration
	</title>

	<para>
		This section assumes that you have successfully compiled and installed
		the &comedi; software, that your hardware device is in your computer,
		and that you know the relevant details about it, i.e., what kind of
		card it is, any jumper settings related to input ranges, the
		I/O base address and IRQ for old non-plug-n-play boards, etc.
	</para>

			Configuration
		</title>
		<para>
		  The good news is: on most systems PCI and USB based boards are
		  configured automatically. The kernel will
		  detect your data acquisition devices, will load the appropriate
		  kernel drivers and will create the
		  <filename>/dev/comedi</filename> entries.
<screen>

Usually these devices belong to the group <systemitem class="groupname">iocard</systemitem> as shown here. The only
		  action you need to take is to become member of this group and
		  then the &comedi; device is ready to be used.
		</para>

		<para>
		  There are a few PCI drivers that for one reason or another
		  do not support auto-configuration, either because there is
		  more than one variant of a board sharing the same PCI device
		  ID (e.g. Advantech PCI-1710 and PCI-1710HG), or because
		  some configuration options are needed (e.g. Amplicon PCI224
		  and PCI234) or for some other reason.  It is also possible
		  to disable auto-configuration when loading the
		  <systemitem>comedi</systemitem> kernel module.  In these
		  cases devices need to be configured manually as for ISA
		  cards. Conversely, most &comedi; drivers supplied with the
		  kernel sources that support auto-configuration may no longer
		  support manual configuration.
		</para>

		<para>
		  By default, the <systemitem>comedi</systemitem> kernel module
		  does not reserve any devices for manual configuration so
		  manual configuration will fail.  To allow devices to be
		  configured manually, set the
		  <parameter>comedi_num_legacy_minors</parameter> module
		  parameter to the number of devices to reserve for manual
		  configuration when loading the <systemitem>comedi</systemitem>
		  kernel module.  If using <command>modprobe</command>, this
		  can be set automatically by editing
		  <filename>/etc/modprobe.conf</filename> or
		  <filename>/etc/modprobe.d/comedi.conf</filename> (depending
		  on the system) to include the line:
		  <screen>
		    options comedi comedi_num_legacy_minors=4
		  </screen>
		  The number <literal>4</literal> in the above line may be
		  adjusted to increase or decrease the number of devices to be
		  reserved for manual configuration.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Old ISA based cards need to be manually configured which is
		  explained here. You only need to read on here 
		  if you have one of these old cards.
                  On embedded systems it might also be necessary to load the
                  driver and then to configure the boards manually.
		  In general manual configuration is done by running
		  the <command>comedi_config</command> command
		  (as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>).
		  Here is an example of how to use the command (perhaps you should read
		  its <command>man</command> page now):
		  <screen>
		    comedi_config /dev/comedi0 labpc-1200 0x260,3
		  </screen>
		  This command says that the <quote>file</quote>
		  <filename>/dev/comedi0</filename> can be used to access the &comedi;
		  device that uses the <parameter class="command">labpc-1200</parameter> board, and that
		  you give it two run-time parameters (<literal>0x260</literal> and
		  <literal>3</literal>). More parameters are possible, and their
		  meaning is driver dependant.
		</para>

		<para>
		  This tutorial goes through the process of configuring &comedi;
		  for two devices, a
		  National Instruments AT-MIO-16E-10, and a
		  Data Translation DT2821-F-8DI.
		</para>

		<para>
			The NI board is plug-and-play.  The current <systemitem>ni_atmio</systemitem> driver
		  has kernel-level ISAPNP support, which is used by default
		  if you do not specify a base address.  So you could simply
		  run <command>comedi_config</command> as
		  <screen>
		    comedi_config /dev/comedi0 ni_atmio
		  </screen>
		  For the preceding <command>comedi_config</command> command to succeed, the
		  <systemitem>ni_atmio</systemitem> kernel module must
		  be loaded first.    For plug-n-play boards on
		  modern kernels, the appropriate comedi kernel modules should get loaded
		  automatically when your computer is booted.
		  The <command>modprobe</command> command can
		  be used to manually load/unload kernel modules, and <command>lsmod</command>
		  will list all the currently loaded modules.
		</para>
		<para>
		  For the Data Translation board, you need to know
		  how the board's jumpers are configured in order to specify the correct
		  <command>comedi_config</command> parameters.  These parameters for the board are given in the
		  <link linkend="lowleveldrivers">kernel drivers</link> section about the <systemitem>dt282x</systemitem>
		  driver.
		  The card discussed here is a DT2821-f-8di.  The
		  entry for the <systemitem>dt282x</systemitem> driver tells you that the
		  <command>comedi_config</command> parameters give the driver the I/O base,
		  IRQ, DMA 1, DMA 2, and
		  in addition the states of the
		  differential/single-ended and unipolar/bipolar jumpers:
		  <itemizedlist>
		    <title>dt282x configuration options:</title>
		    <listitem><para>[0] - I/O port base address</para></listitem>
		    <listitem><para>[1] - IRQ</para></listitem>
		    <listitem><para>[2] - DMA 1</para></listitem>
		    <listitem><para>[3] - DMA 2</para></listitem>
		    <listitem><para>[4] - AI jumpered for 0=single ended, 1=differential</para></listitem>

		    <listitem><para>[6] - AO 0 jumpered for 0=straight binary, 1=2's complement</para></listitem>
		    <listitem><para>[7] - AO 1 jumpered for 0=straight binary, 1=2's complement</para></listitem>
		    <listitem><para>[8] - AI jumpered for 0=[-10,10]V, 1=[0,10], 2=[-5,5], 3=[0,5]</para></listitem>
		    <listitem><para>[9] - AO 0 jumpered for 0=[-10,10]V, 1=[0,10], 2=[-5,5], 3=[0,5],

		  </itemizedlist>
		</para>
		
		<para>
		  So, the appropriate options list might be:
		  <screen>
		    0x200,4,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,2,2
		  </screen>
		  and the full configuration command is:
		  <screen>
		    comedi_config /dev/comedi1 dt2821-f-8di 0x200,4,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,2,2
		  </screen>
		  Setting the DMA channels to 0 disables the use of DMA.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			So now you have your boards configured correctly.
			Since data acquisition boards are not typically well-engineered,
			&comedi; sometimes can't figure out if an old non-plug-n-play
			board is actually in the computer and at the base address you specified.
			If it can't, it assumes you are right.  Both of these boards
			are well-made, so &comedi; will give an error message if it
			can't find them.  The &comedi; kernel module, since it is a part
			of the kernel, prints messages to the kernel logs, which you
			can access through the command <command>dmesg</command> or the file
			<filename>/var/log/messages</filename>.
			Here is a configuration failure (from <command>dmesg</command>):
		</para>

<screen>
comedi0: ni_atmio: 0x0200 can't find board
</screen>

		<para>
			When it does work, you get:
		</para>

<screen>
comedi0: ni_atmio: 0x0260 at-mio-16e-10 ( irq = 3 )
</screen>

		<para>
		  Note that it also correctly identified the board.

		  So now that you have &comedi; talking to the hardware, try to
		  talk to &comedi;.
		  Call the command <command>comedi_board_info</command>, which provides information
		  about each subdevice on the board.
		  Here's part of the output for the USB-DUX sigma
		  board (which is on <filename>/dev/comedi0</filename>), as a result of
